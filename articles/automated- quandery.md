 >An  excerpt  on  the  prevailing  dilemma  in  our  country.  A  tug  of  war  between  automation  and employment.
 
 ## Automation around us
 A couple of days back while listening to the speech of a politician on a news channel,  I concluded how well India is doing in the field of digitisation. We are on the path of progress in all respects and dimensions, brought to us through landmark campaigns like **Make in India** and  **Digital  India**. Online and automated services are now available in virtually every industry. Service providing or commodity producing. Be it getting licenses to run a company or filing GST or just working on the assembly lines during manufacturing. For customers, the process is hassle-free and saves a lot of money by cutting the links with the so-called : middlemen.
 
 ## The other reality
  A few minutes later, on the very same channel, it was covered how a few hundred men and women strong groups were protesting against the authorities, calling out on their incapability in providing them stable, fulfiling jobs. 
 
 They were once part of a flourishing local handloom and carpentry, producing ethnic clothes among other things.  They were hardworking and were earning enough to lead their livelihoods well. All changed when the government eased its policy to attract MNCs for foreign investments and technology.  This brought a two-dimensional change.  On one hand,  a  US-based company brought its automatic power loom which produced clothes in multiples of what was earlier produced by workers. That too in lesser time, human and capital resources. 
 
 Quality too, was comparable to what was beig produced earlier. The owner and management of the cloth factory were grateful and satisfied. Rightly so. The other dimension of the change; is the object of importance - which made the news. **Are technological advancements a boon or a bane?** 
 
 
 ## The dualism
 Are the devices that we depend on so much, and the online services we make use of every day, a hurdle in our nation's progress?  
 For those who say no, the critics will quote the industrial unemployment rates. The positions which were once taken by citizens are now taken by a foreign autobot or an automated mechanical arm. 
 For those who say yes, the supporters will put forward the growth in GDP  which  primarily  is  because of the computing and technology sector, the  reduction  in losses  which  were  a  result  of  ‘under  the  table’  expenses, quick  and  easy  transactions- cum -  clearances improving India’s **Ease of Doing Business rank**.
 Therefore,  for a diverse and unique country like ours, the answer to this question can’t be a simple yes or no. 
 
 ## Where does the trouble lie
 Recalling a basic concept explains, why India on one hand, faces a range of troubles while going digital whereas countries like China and USA didn’t face any such issues, obviously except some slowdown or recession which is an unavoidable trough in the sinusoidal curve of any economy.
 
 A nation, broadly, has three working sectors consuming its workforce, namely, primary or agricultural sector, commodity producing sector, and the third, tertiary or services sector.  There is a  smooth, focused shift from primary sector till tertiary sector in a country. In other words, a new nation generally starts as a primary sector dependent economy, moves to a secondary sector focused one and finally to a tertiary sector. An example being - The US. 
 
 India in the 1980s was a primary sector economy, while by the 21st century we saw a direct jump to tertiary sector, skipping the secondary sector which is considered the largest job creating sector in a developing country. But now, when the authorities woke up to these developments, they tried to absorb workforce by relaxing industrial norms and allowing exploitation of resources to create employment in this commodities production sector (which is not a wise step for environment and ecology, a holistic challenge in itself). \
 
 To this again, automation and mechanical solutions came as a nightmare for the blue collared.  This might suggest authorities to slow down their endeavours towards digitisation or tertiary sector.  However, such a step should not be taken, because the
same thing which takes away jobs actually contributes much more to the national income than what the industries could in the near times. We may lag behind in the race of growth on a global scale. 
 
 ## Amends
The main problem, as believed by various scholars is of the workforce and population. About only 4% of the Indian population is graduate (excluding the factors like technical education or skill). The rest is largely unskilled and lacks a credible education, thus obviously people are unable to get into the growing white collar sector. Providing education and skill-training to people in the working age group is considered to be an all-inclusive solution. A worker turned into a skilful power loom operator can contribute much more , earn moreand therefore sustain with dignity. However, preservation of culture and skill are of importance as well. Such automation and mechanical advancements should not be at the cost of the skilful artisans and producers. Automation should mean hands-free  not hands-less.
